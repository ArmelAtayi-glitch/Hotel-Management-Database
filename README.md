## üìö Overview

The goal of this project is to design and implement a normalized hotel database system that supports key operations like:
- Customer check-in/check-out
- Employee scheduling and payroll
- Vendor supply management
- Invoicing and reporting
- Third-party service tracking
- Governmental compliance

The system follows real-world hotel workflow through user stories and ER modeling, implementing the database in **MySQL Workbench** (v8.0.31).

## üß© Database Design

- Normalization: All tables designed in **BCNF** (except Customer table at 1NF due to dependencies)
- Proper use of **Primary and Foreign Keys**
- Views created for: `Customers`, `Employees`, `Invoices`, `Products`, `Rooms`, and more
- Stored procedures and functions for:
  - Fetching vendor contact info
  - Retrieving room details by customer ID
